# XAMLEngine
A basic game engine written in C# and displayed using XAML.

To use, import the engine as a template in Visual Studio. Create an initializer script that starts your game and call its initialization function in MainWindow.xaml.cs.InitializeScripts()

This is the only edit required to the base engine.
